git add .
git commit -m "Zyron 2.0"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zyron-2.0.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com and click **"Add New Project"**
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Under **Build & Development Settings**, leave everything default
4. Click **Deploy** — Vercel will run `npm install && node build.js` automatically

> ⚠️ **WebSocket Note**: Vercel has limited WebSocket support on the free plan.
> For full proxy support, deploy to **Railway** or **Render** instead — both are free and support WebSockets.
